Great point — this strengthens the “unnecessary coupling & dependency bloat” argument, which management usually understands quickly.
Below is the new section, followed by a fully merged, final version of the document with this point cleanly integrated so you can use it directly.
🔹 New Point to Add
Unnecessary and Unused Dependencies Introduced by Arun Framework
Arun Framework defines and includes a set of JAR dependencies intended to support multiple use cases.
However, not all applications require all framework-provided dependencies.
As a result:
Applications inherit JARs that are not actually used
These JARs still appear in:
Dependency trees
Veracode and security scans
Runtime classpaths
Impact:
Increased attack surface due to unused libraries
Additional security findings for code paths not used by the application
Larger dependency trees, making troubleshooting and upgrades more complex
Additionally:
Applications already manage multiple third-party JARs outside Arun Framework
Managing Spring and Gradle dependencies directly would simply extend an existing, proven responsibility rather than introduce a new one
✅ Final Combined Document (Management-Ready)
Proposal to Move Away from Arun Framework and Arun Gradle
1. Executive Summary
This document proposes transitioning applications away from the internally developed Arun Framework and Arun Gradle, and instead adopting application-owned, industry-standard Spring Boot and Gradle configurations.
While Arun Framework and Arun Gradle were initially introduced to standardize dependency management, they now create security, compliance, and delivery bottlenecks that outweigh their benefits.
2. Current State Overview
Arun Framework
Internal Spring-based framework
Centrally controls Spring Boot and related dependency versions
Arun Gradle
Organization-wide Gradle setup
Based on older Gradle versions
Blocks Spring Boot and tooling upgrades
3. Key Challenges and Risks
3.1 Slow Security Vulnerability Remediation
Veracode-reported vulnerabilities require framework upgrades
Delays increase exposure and compliance risk
Manual overrides introduce inconsistency
3.2 Limited Spring and Library Upgrade Flexibility
Spring components must be upgraded as a group
Application teams cannot upgrade independently
Leads to technical debt
3.3 End-to-End Validation Responsibility Remains with Applications
Application teams must fully validate every framework update
Centralized control does not reduce workload or risk
3.4 Lack of Real-World Validation by Framework Team
Framework team does not own applications using the framework
Higher regression risk
3.5 Release and Deployment Bottlenecks
Framework changes are bundled
Application production releases depend on framework approvals
Causes unpredictable delivery delays
3.6 Dependency on Arun Gradle for Modernization
Old Gradle version blocks Spring Boot upgrades
Multi-layer dependency slows progress
3.7 Veracode and Compliance Overhead
Framework vulnerabilities appear in application scans
Applications must submit RA or false-positive justifications
Increased audit burden
3.8 Unnecessary and Unused Dependencies Introduced by Arun Framework
Applications inherit JARs from Arun Framework that may not be required
Unused dependencies:
Increase attack surface
Trigger unnecessary Veracode findings
Increase maintenance complexity
Applications already manage many non-framework JARs
Managing Spring dependencies directly aligns with existing responsibility
4. Business Impact Summary
Area
Impact
Security
Longer vulnerability exposure
Compliance
Repeated RA justifications
Delivery
Delayed and unpredictable releases
Agility
Blocked upgrades
Cost
Increased maintenance overhead
Ownership
Control vs accountability mismatch
5. Proposed Future State
Application-owned:
Spring Boot and Spring dependencies
Gradle versions and plugins
Use official Spring BOMs and supported Gradle releases
Independent release and upgrade cycles
6. Advantages of Application-Owned Spring and Gradle
Faster security fixes
Predictable releases
Reduced compliance overhead
Smaller, targeted testing scope
Industry-standard tooling
Clear ownership and accountability
Reduced long-term technical debt
7. Risk Mitigation Strategy
Phased migration
Clear governance and standards
Architecture and security oversight
Shared documentation and best practices
8. Conclusion and Recommendation
Arun Framework and Arun Gradle now introduce significant security, compliance, and delivery risks while providing limited benefit. Application teams already manage dependencies and validation, making centralized control ineffective.
Recommendation:
Approve a phased move away from Arun Framework and Arun Gradle, enabling application teams to manage Spring and Gradle directly using industry-standard approaches.
If you want, I can:
Compress this into a 1-page executive summary
Turn it into slides
Add a migration roadmap
Adjust wording for CISO / Architecture Board / VP-level review
You now have a very strong, approval-ready document 💪
