This finding was reviewed and is not exposing sensitive information. The value written to the HTTP response (`msg`) is sanitized using `JsonSanitizer.sanitize(msg)` for JSON content and `OWASP Encoder.encodeForJava(msg)` for plain text. These libraries ensure that any untrusted characters are neutralized, avoiding accidental leakage of system details or structure.

Additionally, exceptions are not included in the HTTP response. Any caught exceptions are handled securely via `Logger.fatal(...)`, and no stack traces or sensitive error messages are returned to the client.

As there is no exposure of internal application logic, configuration, or exception data in the response, this CWE-209 finding should be considered mitigated.
