Here's a complex MuleSoft DataWeave question:

Question:
You have an API that receives the following JSON payload:

{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 101,
      "name": "Alice",
      "department": "HR",
      "joiningDate": "2020-01-15"
    },
    {
      "id": 102,
      "name": "Bob",
      "department": "Finance",
      "joiningDate": "2022-07-10"
    },
    {
      "id": 103,
      "name": "Charlie",
      "department": "IT",
      "joiningDate": "2019-12-01"
    }
  ]
}

You need to transform this payload to match the following output format:

{
  "summary": {
    "totalEmployees": 3,
    "departments": ["HR", "Finance", "IT"]
  },
  "details": [
    {
      "employeeId": 101,
      "employeeName": "Alice",
      "yearsOfService": 4
    },
    {
      "employeeId": 102,
      "employeeName": "Bob",
      "yearsOfService": 2
    },
    {
      "employeeId": 103,
      "employeeName": "Charlie",
      "yearsOfService": 5
    }
  ]
}

The "yearsOfService" should be calculated based on the difference between the current year (2024) and the year in the "joiningDate" field.

Task: Write a DataWeave script to perform this transformation.

Challenge:

1. Ensure no hardcoding of the year in your solution (use the current system year dynamically).


2. Remove any duplicate department names.


3. Format the result to meet the specified structure exactly.



Here is the DataWeave script to solve the problem:

%dw 2.0
output application/json

var currentYear = now() as Date {format: "yyyy"} as Number

---
{
  summary: {
    totalEmployees: sizeOf(payload.employees),
    departments: (payload.employees.department) distinctBy $
  },
  details: payload.employees map (employee) -> {
    employeeId: employee.id,
    employeeName: employee.name,
    yearsOfService: currentYear - (employee.joiningDate as Date {format: "yyyy-MM-dd"}).year
  }
}

Explanation:

1. Current Year Calculation:

now() retrieves the current date and time.

Convert it to a Date type and extract the year using .as Number.



2. Distinct Departments:

Use (payload.employees.department) distinctBy $ to get unique department names.



3. Mapping Employee Details:

payload.employees map (employee) iterates through each employee.

yearsOfService is calculated by subtracting the year of joining from the current year.



4. Final Transformation:

Build the output JSON structure with summary and details as specified.








Hereâ€™s another complex DataWeave transformation example:

Question:
You receive the following JSON payload:

{
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": "ORD001",
      "customer": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe"
      },
      "items": [
        {"productId": "P101", "quantity": 2, "price": 50},
        {"productId": "P102", "quantity": 1, "price": 30}
      ],
      "orderDate": "2023-11-01"
    },
    {
      "orderId": "ORD002",
      "customer": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jane Smith"
      },
      "items": [
        {"productId": "P103", "quantity": 3, "price": 20},
        {"productId": "P104", "quantity": 4, "price": 15}
      ],
      "orderDate": "2024-03-10"
    }
  ]
}

You need to transform the payload into this structure:

{
  "report": {
    "totalOrders": 2,
    "totalRevenue": 230
  },
  "orderDetails": [
    {
      "orderId": "ORD001",
      "customerName": "John Doe",
      "orderDate": "2023-11-01",
      "totalAmount": 130,
      "items": [
        {"productId": "P101", "totalPrice": 100},
        {"productId": "P102", "totalPrice": 30}
      ]
    },
    {
      "orderId": "ORD002",
      "customerName": "Jane Smith",
      "orderDate": "2024-03-10",
      "totalAmount": 100,
      "items": [
        {"productId": "P103", "totalPrice": 60},
        {"productId": "P104", "totalPrice": 60}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Task: Write a DataWeave script to transform the input JSON to the output format.


---

Solution:

%dw 2.0
output application/json

var totalRevenue = payload.orders reduce ((acc, order) -> 
    acc + (order.items reduce ((sum, item) -> sum + (item.quantity * item.price), 0))
, 0)

---
{
  report: {
    totalOrders: sizeOf(payload.orders),
    totalRevenue: totalRevenue
  },
  orderDetails: payload.orders map (order) -> {
    orderId: order.orderId,
    customerName: order.customer.name,
    orderDate: order.orderDate,
    totalAmount: order.items reduce ((sum, item) -> sum + (item.quantity * item.price), 0),
    items: order.items map (item) -> {
      productId: item.productId,
      totalPrice: item.quantity * item.price
    }
  }
}


---

Explanation:

1. Total Revenue Calculation:

Use reduce to calculate the sum of total price for all items in all orders.



2. Order Details Transformation:

Iterate over each order in payload.orders.

Extract orderId, customerName, and orderDate.

Calculate totalAmount for each order by reducing the items array.



3. Item Details Transformation:

For each item, calculate totalPrice as quantity * price.



4. Final Structure:

Combine the summary (report) and detailed transformation (orderDetails) into the output structure.
