Subject: URGENT: LEGIT Approval Required for ACID Framework Security Upgrade - Blocking Prod Deployment

Hi LEGIT Team,

We are following up on our request from yesterday regarding the necessary approval for our changes.

This deployment is critical as it contains the ACID framework upgrade that fixes several JAR-related vulnerabilities. However, our deployment is currently blocked at the code merge step, pending validation from your team.

To clarify the process:

1. Our service deployment must go first.
2. Only after our deployment is complete can the ACID team release their framework changes to production.

Your team's approval is the key dependency to unblock this entire security upgrade path. We request you to please prioritize this review.

Please let us know if you need any additional details from our side.

Thank you for your immediate attention.

Regards,
[Your Name/Team Name]

Shorter Version for Slack/Teams

For a quick but powerful message in a chat platform:

Hi LEGIT Team, following up on the approval needed for our ACID framework upgrade. This is a security fix for JAR vulnerabilities and your sign-off is required to unblock the code merge. Our deployment is a prerequisite for the ACID team's prod release. Requesting your priority review. Thanks!

Why This Works:

· Clear Title: It immediately states the urgency, the responsible team (LEGIT), the purpose (security upgrade), and the impact (blocking deployment).
· Explains the "Why": It highlights that this is not a routine change but a security vulnerability fix, which should automatically raise its priority.
· Clarifies the Process: It succinctly explains the deployment sequence (we go first, then ACID), preventing any confusion about why you are deploying their framework change.
· Identifies the Exact Blocker: It explicitly states the blockage is at the "code merge step," so they know exactly where in their process to look.
· Professional Tone: It remains collaborative and fact-based, which is more effective than sounding frustrated.

This message gives the LEGIT team all the context they need to understand the importance and take swift action.
