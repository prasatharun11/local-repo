Subject: Heartfelt Thanks and Continued Collaboration**

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to personally reach out to share that I have decided to withdraw my resignation from [Your Organization] and will continue contributing to our project as before. While I believe this will be officially communicated by my managers, I wanted to take a moment to personally thank you in advance.

I truly appreciate all the support and understanding you have shown during this time, including your efforts to accommodate the requirements needed to retain me. Your encouragement has been incredibly motivating, and I look forward to continuing our collaboration and contributing to the project's success.

Thank you once again for your unwavering support.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Contact Information]

Would you like me to make it sound even better or add something specific?
