Of course. Here is the revised version based on Option 2, incorporating your excellent points about the filter's purpose and the user-specific behavior. This makes the reasoning even stronger and more logical for the UI team.

Revised Option 2: Direct & Logical

Subject: Urgent Fix: Mandatory Claim Status Filter for Internal Users

Message:

UI Team,

The "Claim Status" filter must always send a value for Global/Local Internal users. Currently, selecting "All" sends a null value. This forces the system to pull the entire dataset, which completely defeats the purpose of having the filter and causes major performance issues.

To solve this huge data load, we made this filter mandatory for internal users at the service level.

Required Fix:
For Global/Local Internal users,ensure the Claim Status filter always sends one of these values:

· "Open" -> Send value 0
· "Closed" -> Send value C
· "All" -> This selection must also send a value. Let's discuss the best approach (e.g., sending both 0,C or a specific "All" flag).

Note: For other user personas, it's fine if the filter sends nothing, as the service will treat it as "no filter."

This is a critical performance fix (Ref: US729195). Please implement this promptly.
