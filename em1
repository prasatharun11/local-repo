Of course. The original message is confusing, mixes technical details with the core problem, and doesn't present a clear, actionable request.

Here are a few corrected versions, ranging from formal to more direct. All are designed to be clear, professional, and to prompt the UI team to take action.

Option 1: Professional & Collaborative (Recommended)

This version is clear, polite, and frames the issue as a necessary performance improvement.

Subject: Action Required: Mandatory Claim Status Filter for Global/Local Internal Users

Message:

Hi UI Team,

To improve performance and data load times for Global and Local Internal users, we need to make the "Claim Status" filter mandatory.

Currently, when "All" is selected for Claim Status, no filter value is passed to the service. This results in a request for the entire dataset, which causes significant performance issues.

Action Needed:
Please update the UI to always pass a value for the Claim Status filter.The valid values are:

· 0 for "Open" claims
· C for "Closed" claims

Selecting "All" should be handled by the service logic. This change is critical to reduce the data load and enhance the user experience.

Please reference ticket US729195 for further context.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Option 2: Direct & Concise

This version is for teams that prefer straightforward, to-the-point communication.

Subject: Urgent Fix: Claim Status Filter Payload Issue

Message:

UI Team,

The "Claim Status" filter must always send a value in the payload. Currently, selecting "All" sends nothing, which forces the system to pull the entire dataset and causes major performance delays.

Required Fix:
Stop allowing"All" to send a null value. Instead, map the selections as follows:

· "Open" -> Send value 0
· "Closed" -> Send value C
· "All" -> This option should be removed or handled by sending both values (please let's discuss the best approach).

This is a mandatory validation requirement (US729195) to prevent huge data loads. Please implement this change promptly.

Option 3: Very Formal (Suitable for a JIRA Ticket or Official Request)

This version is highly structured and leaves no room for ambiguity.

Title: Implement Mandatory Claim Status Filter Validation in UI

Description:

· Background: Global/Local Internal users have access to large datasets. To manage performance, filter conditions are mandatory at the service level.
· Problem: The UI currently does not send any value for the "Claim Status" filter when the user selects "All." This bypasses our data-limiting validation and results in full data-set requests, causing excessive load times.
· Requirement: The UI must always pass a valid filter value for Claim Status to the service.
· Acceptance Criteria:
  1. The Claim Status filter must never send a null or empty value.
  2. The UI selections must map to these exact values:
     · "Open" -> 0
     · "Closed" -> C
  3. The "All" option should be re-evaluated. It can be removed, or the UI can send both 0 and C (implementation to be agreed upon).
· Reference: US729195
· Benefit: This change will significantly reduce data load and improve application response times for all users.

Why these versions are better:

· Clear Action: They start with what is needed from the UI team.
· Problem & Impact: They clearly state the problem (huge data load) and the negative impact (slow performance).
· Specific Solution: They provide the exact values (0 and C) that need to be sent.
· Professional Tone: They avoid blaming language ("you didn't do this") and focus on the solution.
· Structured: They use formatting like bolding and bullet points to make the key information easy to find.

You can choose the option that best fits your team's communication style. Option 1 is generally the most effective.
