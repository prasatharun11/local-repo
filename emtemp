Subject: Update on Endpoint and Store Procedure Creation

Dear [Recipient],

As the creation of a new Stored Procedure by our Mainframe DB team is required for this endpoint, we are currently awaiting their completion.

In the meantime, for Mule validation, we can provide an endpoint in the development region with some dummy data by this Thursday (March 13, 2025). Once the Mainframe Stored Procedure is ready, we will update the endpoint to return responses based on the provided input.

We will share the development (dev/dev2) region CURL in this email thread once it is deployed.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

Best regards,

I've improved clarity, flow, and grammar. Want me to make it sound friendlier or more formal?
