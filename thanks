Subject: Thank You for Your Warm Wishes

Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to take a moment to thank each of you for your kind wishes and support as we celebrated the arrival of our baby boy on January 6, 2025.

Your thoughtful messages mean a lot to me and my family, and I truly appreciate the warmth and positivity you shared during this special time.

Looking forward to catching up and continuing our work together. Thanks again for making this moment even more memorable!

Best regards,
Arunprasath
